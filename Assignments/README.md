Create your own folder with roll number as folder name inside your respective class folder.

Take a copy libNN_1 to your folder and you can change any file in your copied file,
just train your model and save it. commit it and push it.
also add the output as a log file (copy the output and paste it in a txt file) in your folder.

You can ask chatgpt or us for understanding about the code,
but make sure you understand the structure and logic of it.

Example of one training:
In model.h you can change the learning rate.

    // A higher learning rate will make the model converge faster to the  solution.

        _nn.set_learning_rate(0.0000001); to _nn.set_learning_rate(0.0001);

run the unit_test.cpp for testing your model. 

Example 2:

 //changing the no of epochs in unit_test.cpp for training the model


 There are many header files '.h' files change those for more variation in the model.
