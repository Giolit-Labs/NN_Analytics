Neural Network Error Analysis

Error Type: Numerical Instability (NaN Values)

Symptoms:
- All network outputs show nan (Not a Number)
- Error values are nan for all predictions
- Occurs across all input types (training and test data)

Root Causes:

Exploding Gradients
- Gradients become too large during backpropagation
- Weight updates cause numerical overflow
- Results in infinite or NaN values in forward pass

Poor Weight Initialization
- All weights initialized to 0.1
- Causes symmetry breaking issues
- Leads to unstable gradient propagation

Activation Function Issues
- Potential numerical overflow in activation functions
- TANH output activation may not be suitable for regression
- Derivative calculations producing invalid values

Learning Rate Problems
- Current rate (0.0000001) may be inappropriate
- Either too large (causing overshoot) or too small (no learning)

Network Architecture Flaws
- 1-8-1 architecture may be unstable for this problem
- No gradient clipping or regularization
- Poor error propagation through layers

Inputs Causing Failure:
- All normalized x values in range [0.0, 1.0]
- Both training data (sin(x) patterns) and test data
- Simple and complex inputs alike affected
- Periodic function learning triggers numerical instability
