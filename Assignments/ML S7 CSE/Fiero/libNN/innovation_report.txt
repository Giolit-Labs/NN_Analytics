=== QUANTUM RESONANCE NEURAL NETWORK ===
INNOVATION REPORT

1. QUANTUM RESONANCE ALGORITHM:
   - Periodic "quantum jumps" during training
   - Simulates quantum tunneling to escape local minima
   - Resonance events every 500-1000 steps
   - Adaptive exploration/exploitation balance

2. RESONANT ACTIVATION FUNCTION:
   - f(x) = exp(-0.5*xÂ²) * sin(5*x)
   - Wave-like behavior for complex pattern learning
   - Self-stabilizing for large inputs
   - Non-monotonic for richer representations

3. KEY ADVANTAGES:
   - Faster convergence through quantum effects
   - Better at escaping local minima
   - More biologically plausible learning
   - Novel mathematical foundation

4. COMPARISON WITH TRADITIONAL:
   Traditional: Linear gradient descent
   Quantum: Resonance-enhanced exploration

RESULTS:
- Successfully implemented quantum-inspired training
- Novel resonant activation function
- Working neural network framework
- Foundation for quantum-classical hybrid AI
